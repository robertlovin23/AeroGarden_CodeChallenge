# AeroGarden_CodeChallenge

**Part 1** 

I styled two buttons using mixin's from LESS, one with a gradient background and another with no border-radius.

**Part 2**

I used the Magento style guide to determine how to move a block element before another block element.

**Part 3**

I created a React App that loops through the "seed_kit" array and tells a user which garden's would be the best based off the attributes of the selected seed kit.

To start this project up, change to the **'Part-3/garden-finder'** directory, and in the command line type in **'npm start'**.

To initiate the accompanying JSON server, change to the **'Part-3/server'** directory, and in the command line type in **'npm start'**.
